# Disable Chromium's and Chrome's Developer Mode Extension Warning Popup & Elision WWW/HTTPS Hiding & Debugging Extension Popup
**Download** it in the [release section](https://github.com/Ceiridge/Chrome-Developer-Mode-Extension-Warning-Patcher/releases). **The [.NET 6 DESKTOP Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime) is required**.

All patterns and patches auto-update with the `patterns.xml` on every install.\
Note: It seems like Chrome has completely disabled the warning popup anyway, but this patcher still provides other useful patches.

## Supported browsers

## Commandline Options
All commandline options are **optional** and not required. If none are given, the gui will start. **Warning**: The inferior command line cannot uninstall the entire patcher and if you run it with customPath, all other installations will be removed!

```
ChromeDevExtWarningPatcher.exe 
  --groups           Set what patch groups you want to use. See patterns.xml to get the group ids (comma-seperated: 0,1,2,etc.)

  -w, --noWait       Disable the almost-pointless wait after finishing

  --customPath       Instead of automatically detecting and patching all chrome.exe files, define a custom Application-folder path
                     (see README) (string in quotes is recommended)

  --help             Display this help screen.

  --version          Display version information.
```

**Recommended `customPath`s:**
```java
Chrome (default): "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application"
Brave: "C:\Program Files (x86)\BraveSoftware\Brave-Browser\Application"
Edge: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application"

Remember: The folder of the path always needs to include the latest version folder of the browser (e. g. 83.0.1123.123).
(Create a new issue with a path, if you want to contribute to this list.)

## Message to Chromium contributors
This project is not meant for malicious use, especially because patching requires Administrator rights. If an attacker wants to get rid of that notification, they will always be able to do it somehow, since they have access to the computer and to other methods anyway. For example, you could just install a crx-file and allow it with group policies. This makes no sense, because it punishes developers with annoying popups, but crx files that are already packed - and not on the store - can strangely be installed easily.

The idea originates from an answer on StackOverflow that also patched the `chrome.dll` and used to work on old versions.
